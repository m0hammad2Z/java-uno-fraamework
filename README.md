## Uno Game Engine Framework

This is a Uno game framework built with Java that emphasizes object-oriented design principles and extensibility.

### Key Features

* Modular structure with well-defined packages for cards, actions, players, rules, and game engine components.
* Object-oriented design principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction are implemented for maintainability and flexibility.
* Utilizes design patterns like Strategy, Command, Builder, Template Method, and Factory Method for efficient code structure and dynamic behavior.
* Follows SOLID principles for clean and maintainable code.
* Adheres to clean code practices for readability and understandability.
* Leverages powerful Java features like static factory methods, resource management, and immutable classes.

### Package Structure

The framework consists of several packages, each with a specific purpose:

* `uno.card`: Manages Uno cards, including types and colors.
* `uno.action`: Defines interfaces and classes for card actions, player actions, and player command actions.
* `uno.player`: Contains player-related classes, including different player types.
* `uno.rule`: Enforces rules for the Uno game.
* `uno.game`: Contains the main game engine components, game managers, and logic.
* `uno.deck`: Handles the Uno card deck.
* `uno.enums`: Stores all enums used within the framework.
